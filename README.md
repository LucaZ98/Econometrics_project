# Econometrics_project
Repo for the econometrics project for the course "Insurance &amp; Econometrics" from Politecnico di Milano 2022.

TO DO:
- apply the exact same analysis presented in GP EZE et al. 2022 (https://www.intechopen.com/online-first/79907).
  Specifically:
  - Determine monthly exchange rates volatility through standard deviation;
  - Apply the regression model on our features and volatility as response variable;
  - Apply unit root test (ADF);
  - Apply unit root test (ADF) on first differences;
  - Apply Johansen cointegration test (Trace and Maximum Eigenvalue) to the two different models;
  - Estimate of the two VECM;
  - Analyze the impulse response functions.
- undestand the results
- apply other ideas from other papers to further the analysis 

In pi√π:
- Distributed lag model?
- PCA?
- Forecast?
